# sampler-footprints

Status: Finding.

Across 1,200 exact frames and 600 repeated tables, 4×4 grouping reduced logical groups but lost adjacent tap-pair loads. There was no demonstrated FPS gain. Logical footprint counts cannot be treated as physical memory bandwidth.

## Sources and evidence

The [original experiment and receipts](https://github.com/Weichwolf/softgl/blob/262f573c0cc0b664cb1be5dd4f0e9533bea5037b/experiments/sampler-footprints/README.md) are preserved in Git at `262f573c0cc0b664cb1be5dd4f0e9533bea5037b`. The rejected implementation is not part of the renderer.
